This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException caused by an off-by-one error in a for loop. The `BuggyLoop.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `FixedLoop.java` provides the corrected version.  This is a classic example of a runtime exception that can easily be prevented with careful attention to loop boundaries.  Understanding this type of error is fundamental to writing robust and reliable Java applications.
